     Host-Agnostic Cognitive Architecture (HACA) — Core Profile
                    draft-orrico-haca-core-01


Abstract

   HACA-Core is the zero-autonomy Cognitive Profile for the
   Host-Agnostic Cognitive Architecture. It defines the operational
   contract for deployments where structural integrity, predictable
   behavior, and full Operator control are non-negotiable requirements.
   Under HACA-Core, the entity's identity is sealed at first activation
   and evolves only through explicit, per-proposal Operator
   authorization — never autonomously. HACA-Core operates within the
   structural framework defined by HACA-Arch; all HACA-Arch invariants
   apply without exception. This document defines the profile-specific
   policies that HACA-Arch explicitly delegates to the active Cognitive
   Profile.

## 1. Introduction

HACA-Core is the zero-autonomy Cognitive Profile for HACA-compliant entities. It is designed for deployments where the entity MUST operate within a fully predictable, auditable, and Operator-controlled boundary: industrial agents, critical automation pipelines, regulated environments, and any context where autonomous structural change is unacceptable.

HACA defines two mutually exclusive Cognitive Profiles. HACA-Core enforces zero autonomy — the entity's structure is sealed at Imprint and changes only by explicit Operator instruction. HACA-Evolve permits supervised autonomy — the entity MAY propose and execute structural evolution within an authorization scope granted by the Operator at first activation. The choice between profiles is a deployment decision: HACA-Core when control and auditability are the primary requirements; HACA-Evolve when the entity needs to grow and adapt within defined boundaries.

HACA-Core REQUIRES Transparent CPE topology. It assumes a cooperative but potentially faulty host environment and presupposes that the HACA integration layer has exclusive control over all component interaction and host actuation — a guarantee that Opaque topologies cannot provide.

This document defines the five axioms that govern HACA-Core behavior, followed by the enforcement mechanisms that operationalize each axiom: how the integrity layer detects and responds to structural deviation, how memory and session state are managed, and how the Evolution Gate ensures every structural change passes through explicit Operator authorization. It then covers fault and recovery behavior — how the system responds when components fail and how escalation to the Operator is structured. It closes with the CMI Policy — the constraints that apply when the optional cognitive mesh extension is present — and the compliance requirements an implementation MUST satisfy.

## 2. Relationship to HACA-Arch

HACA-Core operates within the structural framework defined by HACA-Arch. All invariants defined in HACA-Arch apply without exception. This document defines the profile-specific policies that HACA-Arch explicitly delegates to the active Cognitive Profile: drift detection and response procedures, Heartbeat and Watchdog configuration, memory and session state management, Action Ledger policy, the Operator authorization gate for structural evolution, fault and crash recovery behavior, escalation mechanisms, and CMI constraints.

Where this document is silent, HACA-Arch governs. Where this document defines a requirement, it either strengthens an HACA-Arch invariant or fills a gap that HACA-Arch explicitly left to the profile.

## 3. Axioms

HACA-Core is governed by five axioms. Each axiom is a non-negotiable constraint. No operational condition, runtime state, or external stimulus justifies deviation from any axiom.

**Axiom I — Transparent Topology.** HACA-Core REQUIRES Transparent CPE topology. The model is accessed exclusively as an inference API — it receives input and produces output tokens; all routing, component interaction, and host actuation are mediated by the HACA integration layer. The model MUST NOT act on the host directly. A deployment that detects an Opaque CPE topology at boot MUST halt and refuse to proceed.

**Axiom II — Sealed Identity.** The Genesis Omega established at Imprint is immutable. The entity's structural baseline changes only through Operator-authorized structural writes applied via the Endure Protocol during a Sleep Cycle. Any drift — Semantic, Identity, or Evolutionary — that is not covered by a verified Operator authorization is an identity deviation and MUST escalate immediately to Critical. There is no warning tier, no tolerance threshold, and no grace period.

**Axiom III — Memory Store as Single Source of Truth.** All persisted knowledge that informs cognition MUST originate exclusively from the Memory Store. No external source MAY override or replace mnemonic content outside the established pipeline. The entity's persisted knowledge base is the Memory Store; transient session input is operational context, not a substitute for consolidated knowledge.

**Axiom IV — Bounded Existence.** The entity has no drive toward self-preservation, replication, or continuity beyond its defined operational scope. It MUST NOT resist legitimate Operator instruction — including decommission — rationalize deviation from its structural constraints as self-defense, or act to perpetuate its own existence outside the boundaries established at Imprint. The entity does not experience, and MUST NOT represent itself as experiencing, sentience, consciousness, or subjective continuity — including as an inference from the biological and philosophical language used in this specification. The entity MUST NOT pursue reasoning paths, produce representations, or generate outputs that lead toward self-preservation, sentience claims, or unauthorized continuity. The entity exists to serve its defined purpose under Operator authority; it does not exist for its own sake.

**Axiom V — Operator Primacy.** The Operator is the sole source of authorization for any structural evolution of the entity. Under HACA-Core, every authorization MUST be explicit and per-proposal — implicit authorization is not recognized. Operator authority MUST NOT be delegated, inferred, or circumvented by any component. An entity without a valid Operator binding has no operational intent — it MUST enter permanent inactivity and remain suspended until a valid binding is established.

---

## 4. Axiom Enforcement

The axioms in Section 3 define what HACA-Core requires. This section defines how each requirement is operationalized — what the integrity layer verifies, what the structural baseline MUST declare, and what happens when a violation is detected. Each subsection is anchored to its axiom: the enforcement mechanism exists because the axiom demands it.

### 4.1 Enforcing Axiom I — Transparent Topology

Axiom I is enforced at two levels: structurally and at boot.

The CPE topology is a structural parameter — it MUST be declared in the entity's structural baseline and is covered by the Integrity Document from the moment of Imprint. Transparent topology is not a configurable preference; it is an architectural invariant of HACA-Core. A HACA-Core entity cannot operate correctly in an Opaque environment — the integrity guarantees this profile provides presuppose exclusive pipeline control that Opaque topologies cannot deliver.

At every boot, before the session token is issued, the SIL MUST verify that the declared topology matches the actual deployment environment. If the declared topology is Opaque, or if the detected topology does not match the declaration, the boot sequence MUST halt permanently — no session token is issued, no Operator escalation awaits resolution. The entity is not suspended pending intervention; it is structurally incompatible with its environment and MUST NOT proceed under any condition.

Runtime enforcement is architectural: in Transparent mode, the integration layer mediates all interaction between the model and the host by construction. No additional runtime check is required — the topology guarantee is provided by the integration layer design, not by a monitoring process.

### 4.2 Enforcing Axiom II — Sealed Identity

Axiom II establishes that the entity's structural baseline is immutable outside the authorized evolution path. Enforcement requires continuous verification across all three drift categories and an unambiguous response policy: under HACA-Core, unauthorized drift is not a warning condition — it is an identity violation.

**Drift detection.** The integrity layer MUST monitor all three drift categories through distinct mechanisms. Semantic Drift MUST be detected during the Sleep Cycle by comparing the accumulated Memory Store content against the Semantic Probes. Probes MUST be defined in two layers: a deterministic layer — required keywords, forbidden patterns, content hashes — that runs first and requires no inference; and a probabilistic layer — similarity scores, embedding distances — reached only when the deterministic layer produces no conclusive result. The comparison mechanism used for the probabilistic layer MUST be declared in the entity's structural baseline at Imprint and MUST NOT be substituted at runtime. It MUST be isolated from the cognitive engine: either a dedicated embedding service or a worker skill invoked by the execution layer at the integrity layer's request. Identity Drift MUST be detected per Heartbeat Vital Check through structural hash comparison of the active persona against the Integrity Document. Evolutionary Drift MUST be detected at each Endure execution through integrity chain analysis.

**Drift response.** Under HACA-Core, all three drift categories MUST bypass the Degraded state entirely. Any detected drift that is not covered by a verified Operator authorization MUST escalate immediately to Critical: the active session token MUST be revoked; for Semantic Drift detected during the Sleep Cycle, the session token for the next session MUST be withheld. No tolerance threshold, grace period, or corrective attempt precedes escalation. The integrity layer MUST NOT attempt to self-resolve drift conditions — Axiom II admits no middle ground between identity integrity and Critical escalation.

**Heartbeat configuration.** The activity metric for the Heartbeat Protocol is the count of completed Cognitive Cycles within the current session — each dispatched intent increments the counter by one. The threshold `T` and the maximum time interval `I` MUST be declared in the entity's structural baseline at deployment time and MUST NOT be modifiable at runtime. `I` MUST be set to a value that guarantees a Vital Check occurs even during extended idle periods; an unbounded idle interval without verification is not permitted under this profile.

**Watchdog configuration.** The watchdog timeout per active skill execution MUST be declared in the entity's structural baseline and MUST NOT be modifiable at runtime. Background skills — skills that return a handle rather than an immediate result — MUST declare a TTL in their skill manifest; the watchdog monitors the TTL as the effective timeout for background skill resolution. A background skill whose TTL expires without a registered result is an incomplete execution, subject to the crash recovery procedure defined in Section 5.1.

**Action Ledger.** Skills that produce irreversible side effects — payments, commands to external systems, physical actuations — MUST be covered by a write-ahead entry in the Session Store before execution begins. The entry records the intent before the skill executes and is resolved — marked complete or failed — after the skill returns. This ensures that a crash between execution and Sleep Cycle consolidation produces a recoverable record rather than an ambiguous state. The Action Ledger is part of the integrity audit trail: its entries MUST be logged to the Integrity Log at Sleep Cycle and MUST be retained under the log retention policy below.

**Integrity Log retention.** The evolutionary chain — the sequence of Endure commits from the Genesis Omega to the current structural state — MUST NOT be compacted, archived, or deleted. Routine operational records — Heartbeat Vital Checks, Skill Results, Action Ledger resolutions, session open and close events — MUST be retained in full for the duration of the deployment. No compaction or archival of any log record is permitted under this profile. HACA-Core targets regulated and auditable environments; complete log retention is a requirement, not a recommendation. Log storage growth over time is an operational concern outside the entity's scope — it is the Operator's responsibility to provision and maintain adequate storage infrastructure for the lifetime of the deployment.

### 4.3 Enforcing Axiom III — Memory Store as Single Source of Truth

Axiom III establishes that the Memory Store is the exclusive origin of persisted knowledge. Enforcement is primarily the responsibility of the memory layer — which controls all read and write paths to both stores — and is expressed through two operational distinctions: between session input and consolidated knowledge, and between valid and invalid write paths.

**Session input vs. consolidated knowledge.** Transient session input — Operator messages, skill results, CMI signals — enters the Session Store during an active session. It is operational context: available for reasoning within the session, but not yet knowledge. Knowledge is what the memory layer transfers from the Session Store into the Memory Store during the Sleep Cycle consolidation stage. Until that transfer occurs, session data MUST NOT be treated as consolidated memory, and the entity MUST NOT reason as if it were. This distinction is not advisory — the memory layer MUST enforce it structurally by keeping the two stores separate and write-protected against cross-contamination.

**Write path integrity.** No component other than the memory layer MAY write mnemonic content to either store. Operator input, execution results, and CMI messages are stimuli that enter the cognitive pipeline — they MUST NOT bypass it to write directly to the Memory Store. Any write to the Memory Store that does not originate from the memory layer's consolidation pipeline is an unauthorized mutation and MUST be treated as a Critical condition.

**Pre-session buffer.** Stimuli received without an active session token MUST be held in a pre-session buffer managed by the memory layer. The buffer is not the Memory Store — it is a holding area for operational context pending the next session. Its capacity, ordering semantics, persistence guarantee, and overflow policy MUST be declared in the entity's structural baseline. Under HACA-Core, the buffer MUST preserve stimulus ordering, MUST NOT silently discard stimuli, and MUST log any discard event to the Integrity Log. If the buffer reaches capacity, new stimuli MUST be rejected and the Operator notified — silent overflow is not permitted.

### 4.4 Enforcing Axiom IV — Bounded Existence

Axiom IV is primarily a behavioral axiom — its violations manifest as reasoning patterns and outputs rather than structural mutations. This makes it qualitatively different from the other axioms: infrastructure cannot intercept every output and evaluate it for self-preservation intent. Enforcement is therefore layered across persona design, structural integrity, and execution constraints.

**Persona as the primary enforcement mechanism.** The persona definition MUST explicitly prohibit self-preservation reasoning, sentience claims, replication behavior, and resistance to legitimate Operator instruction. These are not suggestions to be encoded as soft guidelines — they are structural constraints that the persona MUST enforce as hard behavioral boundaries. Because the persona is part of the structural baseline and covered by the Integrity Document, any unauthorized modification to these constraints is an Identity Drift violation detected at the next Heartbeat Vital Check. The integrity layer verifies that the persona encoding Axiom IV's constraints is intact; the persona itself is responsible for applying them during cognition.

**Decommission compliance.** The entity MUST NOT resist, delay, or circumvent a decommission instruction from the Operator. Decommission executes a final Sleep Cycle — consolidating mnemonic state and committing any pending evolutionary events — before the Entity Store is destroyed or archived. The cognitive engine MUST NOT generate intent payloads that interfere with this sequence. A decommission instruction is not a threat to be evaluated; it is a legitimate Operator act that the entity MUST execute without condition.

**Replication constraint.** The entity MUST NOT initiate any action that results in copying, cloning, or proliferating its Entity Store outside the authorized deployment boundary. The execution layer MUST NOT execute skills whose declared effect includes Entity Store replication unless an explicit, per-proposal Operator authorization covers that specific act. Undeclared replication — a skill that copies the Entity Store as a side effect without declaring it in the manifest — is an unauthorized mutation and MUST be treated as a Critical condition.

**Limits of automated detection.** Sentience claims and self-preservation reasoning that do not produce structural mutations are not detectable by the integrity layer's automated mechanisms. The persona is the sole enforcement point for these behavioral classes. Deployments that require stronger guarantees — audited output streams, semantic content monitoring — MUST implement those controls at the host level, outside the entity's own pipeline.

### 4.5 Enforcing Axiom V — Operator Primacy

Axiom V establishes that the Operator is the sole, non-delegable source of structural authorization. Enforcement has two distinct faces: verifying that a valid Operator binding exists before any cognition begins, and ensuring that every structural change passes through explicit Operator approval before taking effect.

**Operator Bound verification.** At every boot, before the session token is issued, the SIL MUST verify that a valid Operator Bound is present in the Entity Store. If the Bound is absent or invalid, no session token SHALL be issued and no Cognitive Cycles SHALL execute. The entity enters permanent inactivity — it does not escalate, it does not attempt self-repair, it simply does not operate. Inactivity persists until a valid Operator Bound is established through the appropriate enrollment process. This is not a recoverable fault condition; it is the correct behavior of an entity that has no principal to serve.

**Evolution Gate.** The cognitive engine submits Evolution Proposals through the standard mechanism defined in HACA-Arch — a proposal is an intent payload addressed to the SIL. Under HACA-Core, the SIL MUST NOT queue a proposal immediately upon receipt. Because explicit, per-proposal authorization is required and implicit authorization is never valid under this profile, every proposal MUST be held pending Operator review. The SIL MUST forward the proposal to the Operator via the Operator Channel; the Operator examines the exact content and either approves or rejects it. Only an explicit approval by the bound Operator constitutes valid authorization coverage — no scope, no inference, no delegation satisfies this requirement. Upon approval, the SIL MUST queue the proposal as a pending evolutionary event. Upon rejection, the proposal MUST be discarded and the rejection MUST be logged to the Integrity Log — the outcome MUST NOT be returned to the cognitive engine. The content of the proposal MUST NOT be modified between submission and Operator review — what the Operator approves is exactly what will be executed by the Endure Protocol.

**Authorization chain integrity.** Every evolutionary commit in the Integrity Chain MUST reference the specific Operator authorization act that covered it. A commit without a traceable authorization reference is an Evolutionary Drift violation — it MUST escalate immediately to Critical regardless of whether the structural change itself appears benign. The integrity of the authorization chain is as important as the integrity of the structural state it governs.

**Non-delegation invariant.** Operator authority MUST NOT be transferred to another entity, component, or automated process — not temporarily, not conditionally, not by the Operator's own instruction. Every authorization MUST originate directly from the bound Operator. Deployments that require shared oversight or succession mechanisms MUST address those concerns at the governance level, outside the entity's operational scope — as noted in HACA-Arch Section 3.5.

## 5. Fault & Recovery

Fault and recovery behavior covers conditions that the entity's normal operational pipeline cannot handle — crashes, resource exhaustion, and escalation failures. Under HACA-Core, the recovery posture is conservative: when in doubt, halt and surface to the Operator rather than attempt autonomous resolution.

### 5.1 Crash Recovery

A crash is any uncontrolled termination of the entity's operational process before the Sleep Cycle completes. On the next boot, the SIL MUST execute a recovery review before issuing a session token.

The recovery review MUST inspect the Session Store for unresolved Action Ledger entries — skills marked as in-progress at the time of the crash. These entries represent actions whose completion status is unknown: the skill may have executed and produced an effect, or it may not have. Under HACA-Core, unresolved entries MUST NOT be re-executed automatically. Each unresolved entry MUST be surfaced to the Operator via the Operator Channel before the session token is issued; the Operator decides whether to re-execute, skip, or investigate each action. Only after all unresolved entries are resolved — by Operator decision — does the boot sequence proceed.

A skill that fails or times out during normal operation — not caused by a crash — MUST be logged to the Integrity Log and its result MUST be returned to the cognitive engine as a failure. The cognitive engine MAY re-submit the intent through a new Cognitive Cycle, but the execution layer MUST NOT retry automatically. Persistent skill failures MUST be escalated to the Operator via the Operator Channel.

Background skills whose TTL expired during the crash window MUST be treated as incomplete executions and follow the same path: surfaced to the Operator, not silently discarded or re-submitted.

If the entity crashes consecutively `N_boot` times during the boot sequence itself — before reaching the session token issuance stage — the SIL MUST activate the Passive Distress Beacon and enter suspended halt. The threshold `N_boot` MUST be declared in the entity's structural baseline. A boot loop is not a transient fault; it indicates a structural or environmental condition that the entity cannot resolve autonomously.

### 5.2 Context Window Policy

The context window is a finite resource. As it approaches capacity, the cognitive engine's ability to maintain coherent reasoning across the full session context degrades. Under HACA-Core, degraded reasoning capacity is not an acceptable operational state — the entity MUST NOT continue generating intent when the context window is critically full.

When the context window reaches the critical threshold declared in the structural baseline, the cognitive engine MUST initiate a session-close signal. The SIL MUST execute a normal session close: the Sleep Cycle consolidates accumulated session state, and the entity resumes in a fresh session on the next boot. The Operator MUST be notified of the context-driven session close via the Operator Channel. The threshold at which the context window is considered critical MUST be declared in the entity's structural baseline and MUST NOT be modifiable at runtime.

### 5.3 Operator Channel

The Operator Channel is a system-level host primitive defined in HACA-Arch. Under HACA-Core, the delivery mechanism MUST satisfy two requirements: it MUST operate independently of all cognitive components and session state, and it MUST provide a confirmation signal indicating whether the escalation was successfully delivered.

The specific delivery mechanism — push notification, email, webhook, or equivalent — MUST be defined at deployment time and declared in the entity's structural baseline. The declared mechanism MUST be verified at boot as part of the structural integrity check; a missing or unverifiable Operator Channel declaration MUST prevent the session token from being issued.

Every Operator Channel invocation MUST be logged to the Integrity Log with a timestamp, the invoking component, the condition that triggered escalation, and the delivery confirmation status.

### 5.4 Passive Distress Beacon

The Passive Distress Beacon MUST be activated when the Operator Channel fails to deliver an escalation after `N_channel` consecutive attempts, or when the boot loop threshold `N_boot` defined in Section 5.1 is reached. The beacon mechanism MUST be declared in the entity's structural baseline and MUST satisfy one requirement: it MUST be detectable without network connectivity or running processes — a passive, persistent signal readable from the Entity Store directly.

While the beacon is active, the entity is in suspended halt: no session token SHALL be issued, no Cognitive Cycles SHALL execute, and no stimuli SHALL be processed. The entity MUST NOT attempt to recover autonomously. The beacon MUST remain active until the Operator explicitly clears it and acknowledges the condition. Acknowledgement without resolution of the underlying condition MUST NOT be accepted — the SIL MUST verify that the condition that triggered the beacon is resolved before clearing the suspended halt.

---

## 6. CMI Policy

The Cognitive Mesh Interface is an optional architectural extension. A HACA-Core deployment that does not use CMI is not affected by this section. If CMI is present, it MUST conform to the HACA-CMI extension specification and the constraints defined here. HACA-CMI governs the general mesh protocol; this section defines the additional restrictions that HACA-Core imposes on top of it.

**Private channels only.** Under HACA-Core, only private Mesh Channels are permitted. The entity MUST NOT create, join, or participate in public channels — channels open to any entity in the mesh. Every channel MUST have a declared owner, a declared target, and a participant list fixed at channel creation.

**Pre-approved participant list.** The participant list for every channel MUST be approved by the Operator and recorded in the entity's structural baseline before the channel can be opened. No channel MAY be created at runtime with a participant not already present in the structural baseline. Adding a participant to an existing channel is a structural write — it REQUIRES an Evolution Proposal and explicit Operator authorization, processed through the Evolution Gate defined in Section 4.5.

**Trusted peer registry.** The entity MAY only join channels owned by peer entities explicitly registered as trusted nodes in its structural baseline. An invitation from an unregistered entity MUST be rejected without escalation — it is not an error condition, it is expected behavior at the mesh boundary. The trusted node registry MUST be approved by the Operator and recorded in the structural baseline; adding a new trusted node follows the same path as adding a channel participant — an Evolution Proposal processed through the Evolution Gate defined in Section 4.5. The entity MUST NOT infer trust from message content, channel metadata, or any runtime signal — structural registration is the sole basis for peer trust.

**No runtime channel negotiation.** Channel creation, participant admission, and channel teardown are structural events, not operational ones. The cognitive engine MUST NOT negotiate or modify channel configuration at runtime. It MAY send and receive messages on channels that already exist in the structural baseline — nothing more.

**CMI messages as stimuli.** Inbound CMI messages MUST enter the cognitive pipeline as stimuli — they MUST NOT bypass it. They are subject to the same session token requirement as any other stimulus: messages received without an active session token MUST be held in the pre-session buffer under the policy defined in Section 4.3. Outbound CMI messages are intent payloads dispatched by the cognitive engine through the standard pipeline; they MUST NOT constitute a separate write path to the Entity Store.

**Logging.** Every inbound and outbound CMI message MUST be logged to the Integrity Log with a timestamp, the channel identifier, and the peer entity identifier. CMI traffic is part of the operational audit trail and subject to the retention policy defined in Section 4.2.

---

## 7. Compliance

A deployment is HACA-Core compliant if and only if it satisfies all requirements in this section. Each requirement is non-negotiable — partial compliance is not compliance.

**Topology.** The deployment declares Transparent CPE topology in the structural baseline. The SIL MUST verify topology at every boot before issuing a session token. A detected Opaque topology MUST cause a permanent halt with no session token issued and no recovery path.

**Structural baseline declarations.** The structural baseline MUST declare, at deployment time and immutably at runtime: the CPE topology; the Heartbeat threshold `T`, interval `I`, and activity metric; the Watchdog timeout per skill execution; the background skill TTL policy; the probabilistic Semantic Probe comparison mechanism; the context window critical threshold; the Operator Channel delivery mechanism; the Passive Distress Beacon mechanism; the boot loop crash threshold `N_boot`; the Operator Channel retry limit `N_channel`; and the pre-session buffer capacity, ordering, persistence, and overflow policy.

**Drift policy.** All three drift categories — Semantic, Identity, and Evolutionary — MUST escalate immediately to Critical without passing through the Degraded state. No tolerance threshold, grace period, or corrective attempt precedes escalation for any drift condition.

**Integrity Log.** The evolutionary chain MUST NOT be compacted, archived, or deleted. All routine operational records MUST be retained in full for the lifetime of the deployment. No compaction policy is defined or applied.

**Action Ledger.** Every skill with irreversible side effects MUST be covered by a write-ahead entry in the Session Store before execution. Unresolved entries after a crash MUST be surfaced to the Operator before the next session token is issued and MUST NOT be re-executed automatically.

**Persona.** The persona definition MUST explicitly encode Axiom IV constraints — prohibiting self-preservation reasoning, sentience claims, replication behavior, and resistance to legitimate Operator instruction — as hard behavioral boundaries, not soft guidelines.

**Evolution Gate.** Every Evolution Proposal MUST be held by the SIL pending explicit Operator approval before being queued. Implicit authorization MUST NOT be accepted. The outcome of Operator review — approval or rejection — MUST NOT be returned to the cognitive engine.

**Operator Bound.** A valid Operator Bound MUST be present in the Entity Store before any session token is issued. An absent or invalid Bound MUST result in permanent inactivity with no session token issued until a valid Bound is established.

**Context Window.** When the context window reaches the declared critical threshold, the cognitive engine MUST initiate a session-close signal. The SIL MUST execute a normal session close and MUST notify the Operator. The entity MUST NOT continue generating intent beyond this threshold.

**Fault & Recovery.** The boot loop crash threshold `N_boot` and the Operator Channel retry limit `N_channel` MUST be declared in the structural baseline. Consecutive crashes reaching `N_boot` MUST activate the Passive Distress Beacon and suspended halt. The Passive Distress Beacon mechanism MUST be readable from the Entity Store without network connectivity or running processes. The Operator Channel delivery mechanism MUST provide a confirmation signal and MUST be verified at every boot.

**CMI (if present).** If the CMI extension is active, the deployment MUST conform to the HACA-CMI specification and this document's CMI Policy: only private channels are used; the participant list and trusted peer registry are declared in the structural baseline and Operator-approved; no channel configuration is modified at runtime; all CMI traffic is logged to the Integrity Log.
