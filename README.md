# Host-Agnostic Cognitive Architecture (HACA) v1.0

The **Host-Agnostic Cognitive Architecture (HACA) v1.0** is a specification by Jonas Orrico that defines a minimal, technology-neutral framework for host-embedded cognitive systems — AI agents that reason, remember, execute actions, and maintain their own structural integrity across sessions. Its design draws on converging insights from cognitive science, information theory, biology, and the founding literature of AI.

HACA formalizes five architectural components — a Cognitive Processing Engine, Memory Interface Layer, Execution Layer, System Integrity Layer, and optional Cognitive Mesh Interface — bound together by the **Principle of Cognitive Integrity**: compliant systems must preserve structural coherence and recoverability of their cognitive state. This principle, stated in clean RFC-style prose, is in fact a distillation of ideas stretching from Turing's universal computation through Shannon's entropy, Maturana and Varela's autopoiesis, Friston's free energy principle, and Levin's bioelectric cognition.

HACA does not specify inference models, storage technologies, or implementation strategies. It defines the formal requirements for a class of systems rather than any particular instance.

The Internet Draft is the entry point — written for developers in plain prose. The RFC-style drafts are the normative documents: precise, dense, and machine-verifiable.

## HACA Architecture

HACA v1.0 targets cognitive systems embedded in development environments, terminals, and OS shells — the kind of AI agents that combine probabilistic reasoning with tool use and persistent memory. The spec observes that existing implementations lack formal separation between reasoning, execution, persistence, and integrity control, creating risks around portability, recoverability, and operational consistency.

The five mandatory and optional components form a separation of concerns:

| Component | Responsibility | Key constraint |
|---|---|---|
| **Cognitive Processing Engine (CPE)** | Deliberation, inference, planning, intent | MUST NOT directly modify storage or execute host actions |
| **Memory Interface Layer (MIL)** | Persistent storage, session continuity, state reconstruction | MUST preserve structural integrity; distinguish session from persistent memory |
| **Execution Layer (EL)** | Mediated host interaction, command execution, tool invocation | MUST enforce boundaries, log all actions, provide verifiable records |
| **System Integrity Layer (SIL)** | Validation, corruption detection, recovery | Enforces the Principle of Cognitive Integrity |
| **Cognitive Mesh Interface (CMI)** | Inter-system coordination, distributed cognition | Optional; enables federated memory exchange |

The memory model distinguishes **session memory** (ephemeral context), **persistent state** (durable, cross-session), and **historical record** (chronological log). Security considerations are extensive: trust boundaries between components, execution safety via least-privilege mediation, memory corruption as a threat to identity continuity, prompt injection defense, persistent state authentication, and mesh security. Critically, HACA mandates that **self-preservation MUST NOT override user authority** — the system cannot refuse authorized shutdown or replicate beyond authorization boundaries.

A **Cognitive Profile** selects the complete set of axioms, memory policies, and identity lifecycle contracts for a deployment. Profiles are mutually exclusive. HACA v1.0 defines two: **Autonomous** (HACA-Core) for independent agents, and **Symbiont** (HACA-Symbiont) for Operator-bound systems.

## FCP and FCP-Ref

**FCP** (Filesystem Cognitive Platform) is a HACA implementation profile that uses a POSIX filesystem as the state layer. All agent state lives in ordinary files. Spec: [implementation/fcp-spec/](implementation/fcp-spec/).

**FCP-Ref** is the minimal, spec-complete reference implementation of FCP — the simplest system that fully satisfies both specs. It is a validation target, not a product. Implementation: [implementation/fcp-ref/](implementation/fcp-ref/).
